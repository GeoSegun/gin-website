## Gin v1.11.0 Has Arrived

We're excited to announce the release of Gin v1.11.0, bringing a major set of new features, performance tweaks, and bug fixes to the beloved web framework. This release continues Gin's commitment to speed, flexibility, and modern Go development.

### üåü Key Features

- **Experimental HTTP/3 Support:** Gin now supports experimental HTTP/3 via [quic-go](https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go)! If you're eager to try the latest web transport protocols, now's your chance. ([#3210](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/pull/3210))

- **Better Form Binding:** We've made big improvements to form binding:
  - Support for array collection formats in forms ([#3986](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/pull/3986))
  - Custom string slice unmarshalling for form tags ([#3970](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/pull/3970))
  - Default values for collections ([#4048](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/pull/4048))

- **Enhanced Binding Types:** Bind plain text easily with the new `BindPlain` method ([#3904](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/pull/3904)), plus support for unixMilli and unixMicro formats ([#4190](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/pull/4190)).

- **Context API Improvements:** `GetXxx` now supports more native Go types ([#3633](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/pull/3633)), making type-safe context data retrieval easier.

- **Filesystem Updates:** The new `OnlyFilesFS` is now exported, tested, and documented ([#3939](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/pull/3939)).

### üöÄ Performance & Enhancements

- **Faster Form Data Handling:** Internal optimizations for form parsing boost performance ([#4339](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/pull/4339)).
- Refactored core, rendering, and context logic for robustness and clarity ([full PR list in changelog](../releases/release111.md)).

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- **Middleware Reliability:** Fixed a rare bug where middleware could re-enter unexpectedly ([#3987](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/pull/3987)).
- Improved TOML form binding stability ([#4193](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/pull/4193)).
- No more panics when handling "method not allowed" requests on empty trees ([#4003](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/pull/4003)).
- General improvements to context handling, race conditions, and more.

### üîß Build, Dependency & CI Updates

- Support for **Go 1.25** in CI/CD workflows, plus new linters enabled for stricter code health ([#4341](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/pull/4341), [#4010](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/pull/4010)).
- Trivy vulnerability scanning now integrated with CI ([#4359](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/pull/4359)).
- Multiple dependency upgrades, including `sonic`, `setup-go`, `quic-go`, and others.

### üìñ Documentation

- Expanded documentation, updated changelogs, improved grammar and code samples, and new Portuguese docs ([#4078](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/pull/4078)).
